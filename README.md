# PNA - Portfolio

This is the repo for my first Major Project while at the Coder Factory Academy bootcamp - my personal Portfolio.

### About
I really wanted to put myself into this website - it should reflect myself and my professional career as a developer accurately. I wanted to design a website with an aesthetic that I really appreciate, and has a personal flair. I want to be able to showcase my skills through the website itself, and leave a lasting impact on the user. I want to make something that makes recruiters want to hire me right off the bat.

This portfolio went through a number of interations in the design stage, and is influenced by a number of websites found online. It is built on Rails using Bootstrap/SASS with a bit of Ruby.

Other notable programs (or otherwise) used to make this include: Sketch, Adobe Photoshop, FontAwesome, Devicons.

Best used with Google Chrome.

### Design
There was a long design process involved in creating this website (may have been heavily influenced by the documentary Abstract: The Art of Design on Netflix, haha), and there were a few iterations of the website, and a lengthy process on the final design to decide it's finer details.

I first created a Trello board to create user stories, to figure out what I want to go into the website, and to note any useful designs or plugins I could use.

After this, I continued to search through numerous websites like Dribbble and Pintrest for inspiration. The below are the various design I had come up with ultimately through Sketch.

At this point, I found a design that I really liked (heavily influenced by strv.com), and started to play around with the colours to find something I liked. I ultimately stuck with red.

At this point, I designed what most of the website would roughly look like.

### Building
The building process took longer than expected, however ultimately the design that was finalised was kept.

The problems encountered include the following:
* ***Animations***
  * **An animation for the banner text** - I wanted to have the red line grow longer, and then the text would 'flow' out of the sides of the line. This proved to be extremely difficult to do, as getting JavaScript to work was not easy, and wasn't working how I wanted to. Some CSS techniques were used too, but ultimately this was skipped as it would take a lot of time to figure out.
  * **Animations for logos** - At first, I had included actual png assets as my logos for my website, however I was not able to easily implement animations for them as they do now (turn red). I then came across a classmate's recommendation of FontAwesome (cheers Nick!) to use, which can easily be implemented via a CDN, and manipulated the same way one would manipulate text. Devicons were also used for icons that were missing from FontAwesome, and worked exactly the same.
* ***Email Forms*** - I was able to create a set of email forms using the Bootstrap forms, however to have them actually work was another problem. I was at a certain stage attempting to get it working, however my Teacher in the end said that we would learn how to get it working in the future, and was okay with me leaving it there.
* ***Fun Section*** - This part was hard to come up with many things, as I wanted to put a lot of content here, but there simply proved to be no time. I will come back to this at a later point.



### Enjoy :)
